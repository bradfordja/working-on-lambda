Java back-end code with Lambda Java api

To create an AWS Lambda function in Java that manages Engineer records, you will need to set up an AWS environment and write Java code to handle CRUD operations. Below is a step-by-step guide with system requirements, a sample use case, and sample code.

### AWS System Requirements:

1. **AWS Lambda**: To run the Java code without provisioning servers.
2. **Amazon RDS**: To store the Engineer records in a relational database.
3. **IAM Role**: To grant the Lambda function permissions to access RDS and other required services.
4. **AWS SDK for Java**: To facilitate the interaction with AWS services from within the Java code.
5. **AWS API Gateway** (optional): To expose the Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints for the front-end application to consume.
6. **Connection Pooling Library**: Use a library such as HikariCP for efficient database connection pooling.
7. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed to develop and build the Lambda function.

### Setting IAM Permissions:

- Create an IAM role for the Lambda function with permissions to access RDS and any other necessary AWS services.
- If you are using the API Gateway, make sure to set the appropriate permissions for it as well.

### Sample Use Case:

- **createEngineer**: Inserts a new engineer record into the RDS database.
- **updateEngineer**: Modifies an existing engineer record in the RDS database.
- **getEngineerById**: Retrieves an engineer record from the RDS database using the `userId`.
- **getEngineerAll**: Retrieves all engineer records from the RDS database.

### Java Lambda Functions:

Here's a simplified version of what the Lambda function code might look like in Java, using the AWS Lambda Java core library and JDBC for database operations.

```java
// You need to include the following dependencies: AWS Lambda Java Core, JDBC, HikariCP, and any other required library

import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class EngineerManager implements RequestHandler<RequestClass, ResponseClass> {
  
  // Initialize a connection pool (HikariCP)
  private static final HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
  private static final HikariDataSource ds;
  
  static {
    config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://your-rds-instance:3306/yourdatabase");
    config.setUsername("yourusername");
    config.setPassword("yourpassword");
    config.addDataSourceProperty("cachePrepStmts", "true");
    config.addDataSourceProperty("prepStmtCacheSize", "250");
    config.addDataSourceProperty("prepStmtCacheSqlLimit", "2048");
    ds = new HikariDataSource(config);
  }

  public ResponseClass handleRequest(RequestClass input, Context context) {
    LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();
    logger.log("Input: " + input);

    // Based on the input, determine which operation to perform
    // For example:
    if ("createEngineer".equals(input.getAction())) {
      // ... call createEngineer method
    }
    // Other operations (updateEngineer, getEngineerById, getEngineerAll)
    // ...

    return new ResponseClass();
  }

  // Method to create an engineer
  private void createEngineer(Engineer engineer) {
    // SQL query to insert a new engineer record
    String sql = "INSERT INTO engineers (userId, firstName, lastName, title, statusId, siteId) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);";

    // Use the connection pool to get a connection
    try (Connection conn = ds.getConnection();
         PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
      stmt.setInt(1, engineer.getUserId());
      stmt.setString(2, engineer.getFirstName());
      stmt.setString(3, engineer.getLastName());
      stmt.setString(4, engineer.getTitle());
      stmt.setInt(5, engineer.getStatusId());
      stmt.setInt(6, engineer.getSiteId());
      stmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
      // Handle exceptions
    }
  }

  // Methods for updateEngineer, getEngineerById, getEngineerAll would follow a similar pattern
  
  // ... (additional methods)

  // Engineer interface
  public interface Engineer {
    int getUserId();
    String getFirstName();
    String getLastName();
    String getTitle();
    int getStatusId();
    int getSiteId();
    String getSiteName();
    String getStatus();
  }
  
  // RequestClass and ResponseClass need to be implemented
  // ...
}

// You would also need to create POJOs for RequestClass and ResponseClass to represent incoming requests and outgoing responses
```
Note that the code above is a template and requires further implementation based on your specific use case and logic.

Deployment:
* 		Package the Java code: Create a deployment package that includes your compiled Java code and any dependencies.
* 		Create the Lambda function: Upload the deployment package to AWS Lambda and configure it with the necessary IAM role.
* 		Test the Lambda function: Invoke the Lambda function with sample events to ensure it works as expected.
* 		Expose via API Gateway (optional): If you want to invoke these Lambda functions via HTTP requests from your React front-end, set up AWS API Gateway to trigger the Lambda functions.
This code sets the foundation for Lambda-based CRUD operations with Java, and you would expand upon it to fully handle your application's logic and data handling.
